Red Dead Redemption 2 - cannot play

It stays on the loading screen forever and I can't play

Try going to Rockstar Website and clicking on Get Launcher then try to find the file launcher.exe Run this file as administrator

if you still have problems .. do this ..

Verify the game in Steam.
This WILL take a while to complete. Let it finish.
When all done, right click Rockstar Launcher, which you should have a Desktop Shortcut for, and click Run As Admin. Then launch RDR2 from that Launcher, not Steam.

If the game still has an issue launching.
Go to here and delete the SYSTEM.XML file and SGA files.
Documents > Rockstar Games > Red Dead Redemption 2 > Settings
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Settings
or
%USERPROFILE%\DocumentOs\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Settings
Or rename the directorie Settings -> Settings.old

Then relaunch the game, again from the launcher, not steam.
